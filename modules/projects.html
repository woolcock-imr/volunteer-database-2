                              Are you a smoker aged 25-45 years? We are running a study to find out if it is possible to open up the airways with a puffer and reduce the effects of smoking on your lungs. If eligible, you will receive medical examination, lung testing and study medication at no cost.

                              A world-first study looking at how some commonly-prescribed COPD medications work deep inside the lungs, using new and advanced measurements of lung function and medical imaging technology

                              <li module=projects_circomed style='color:white'><u>How is your COPD affected by sleep disturbances?</u></li>
                              In COPD, sleep disturbances appear to be common. This may include waking during the night, poor quality sleep and waking with breathing problems. The aim of this study is to determine how commonly sleep disturbance occur and whether they are linked to COPD severity, changes in lung function or pre-existing sleep disordered breathing.

                              If you have a child between the ages of 4 and 18 who uses an inhaler for asthma you are invited to take part in a research study about how and why children come to manage their own asthma from the parentsâ€™ perspective.

                              At the Woolcock we are trialling a combination of a behavioural intervention with a short script of a new medication that we hope will improve sleep and daytime performance. If you think you would like to be involved in this study please follow this link for more details.

                              This study will investigate the effects the sound that comes from Wind farms (called infrasound) and traffic noise have on people when compared to silence. We will look at the effects on sleep and various other aspects of health.
                              <br>The study will take place over 3 weekend in our Sleep Centre.
