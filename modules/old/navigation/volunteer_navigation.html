                        Are you a smoker aged 25-45 years? We are running a study to find out if it is possible to open up the airways with a puffer and reduce the effects of smoking on your lungs. If eligible, you will receive medical examination, lung testing and study medication at no cost.

                        <li data-name=projects_circomed style='color:blue'><u>How is your COPD affected by sleep disturbances?</u></li>
                        In COPD, sleep disturbances appear to be common. This may include waking during the night, poor quality sleep and waking with breathing problems. The aim of this study is to determine how commonly sleep disturbance occur and whether they are linked to COPD severity, changes in lung function or pre-existing sleep disordered breathing.

                        We are looking for volunteers to investigate a new way of monitoring lung function with a simple breathing test at home that could revolutionise long-term disease management in COPD.

                        We are investigating the symptomatic treatment of REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) with the natural hormone Melatonin.  Participants will participate in a sleep study to determine the presence of RBD and randomised into two groups, one group will take the active drug (Melatonin), and the second group a placebo.  Participants will be required to complete a daily sleep diary to monitor efficacy of medications, in addition to monthly questionnaires.  All participants need to be able to participate in two overnight sleep studies and be willing to travel to the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research on four separate occasions.  The study is approximately 16 weeks in duration.

                        This study will investigate the effects the sound that comes from Wind farms (called infrasound) and traffic noise have on people when compared to silence. We will look at the effects on sleep and various other aspects of health.
                        <br>The study will take place over 3 weekend in our Sleep Centre.
